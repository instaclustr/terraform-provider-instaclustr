# Terraform Instaclustr Provider

A [Terraform](http://terraform.io) provider for managing Instaclustr Platform resources.

## Documentation

Documentation on using the Instaclustr Terraform Provider is available through [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/instaclustr/instaclustr/latest/docs).

## Migrating from v1 to v2 of the Instaclustr Terraform Provider

With the v2 version of the Instaclustr Terraform Provider, new resources have been introduced and schemas of existing resources have been changed. While the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/instaclustr/instaclustr/latest/docs) contains the schema definitions of each resource, for a tool assisted approach of migrating to the v2 version of the Terraform Provider, see our support article on [importing Terraform resources](https://www.instaclustr.com/support/api-integrations/integrations/terraform-code-generation/).

## Further information and documentation

This provider makes use of the Instaclustr API. For further reference on the Instaclustr API, visit see [Instaclustr API Documentation website](https://docs.api.instaclustr.com).
