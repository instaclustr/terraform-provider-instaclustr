# Terraform Instaclustr Provider

A [Terraform](http://terraform.io) provider for managing Instaclustr Platform resources.  

It provides a flexible set of resources for provisioning and managing [Instaclustr based clusters](http://instaclustr.com/) via the use of Terraform.  

For general information about Terraform, visit the [official website](https://terraform.io/) and [GitHub project page](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).

For further information about Instaclustr, please see [FAQ](https://www.instaclustr.com/resources/faqs/) and [Support](https://support.instaclustr.com/hc/en-us) 

## Key benefits

- Removes the need to write custom code integration directly with the Instaclustr API
- Instaclustr based infrastructure as code deployments with minimal effort
- Ease of integration into existing terraform or automated CI/CD based workflows
- Ease of customisation and configuration in order to meet operational requirements
- Use of existing Instaclustr authentication methodologies

## Requirements

- Terraform 0.10.x or higher
- Go 1.14 or higher

## Building The Provider

Clone the provider source code

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/instaclustr; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/instaclustr
$ git clone https://github.com/instaclustr/terraform-provider-instaclustr.git
```

Build the source into executable binary

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/instaclustr/terraform-provider-instaclustr
$ make build
```

Install the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/instaclustr/terraform-provider-instaclustr
$ make install
```

For further details on Provider installation please see the [Terraform installation guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin).

## Authentication

This provider requires an API Key in order to provision Instaclustr resources. To create an API key, please log into the [Instaclustr Console](https://console.instaclustr.com) or signup for an account [here](https://console.instaclustr.com/user/signup) if you dont have one.  Navigate to `Account` -> `API Keys` page, locate the `Provisioning` role and click `Generate Key`.  This username and API key combination should then be placed into the provider configuration:

```
provider "instaclustr" {
    username = "<Your instaclustr username here>"
    api_key = "<Your provisioning API key here>"
}
```
or just input them when Terraform indicates you.

```
resource "instaclustr_cluster" "example" {
    cluster_name = "testcluster"
    node_size = "t3.small"

### Migrating from 0.0.1 &rarr; 0.1.0
A schema change has been made from 0.0.1 which no longer supports the `bundles` argument and uses `bundle` blocks instead. This change can cause `terraform apply` to fail with a message that `bundles` has been removed and/or updating isn't supported. To resolve this -<br>
1. Change all usages of the `bundles` argument &rarr; `bundle` blocks (example under example/main.tf)
2. In the .tfstate files, replace all keys named `bundles` with `bundle` in resources under the Instaclustr provider.
