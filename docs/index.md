## Migrating from v1 to v2 of the Instaclustr Terraform Provider

With the v2 version of the Instaclustr Terraform Provider, new resources have been introduced and schemas of existing resources have been changed. While the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/instaclustr/instaclustr/latest/docs) contains the schema definitions of each resource, for a tool assisted approach of migrating to the v2 version of the Terraform Provider, see our support article on [importing Terraform resources](https://www.instaclustr.com/support/api-integrations/integrations/terraform-code-generation/).
