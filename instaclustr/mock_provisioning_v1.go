SetupMock used to mock request/response calls to the provisioning api

Usage example:

client := SetupMock(t, id, fmt.Sprintf(`{"id":"%s"}`, id), 202)

Where:
 t: is the testing library,
 request: is the resource path in this case the id of the cluster,
 response: is the api response in this case a string representing a json object with an id the same as the request
 responseCode: is the api response code in this case 202

	client := new(APIClient)

		// Test request parameters

			Body: ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewBufferString(response)),
			// Must be set to non-nil value or it panics
			Header: make(http.Header),
